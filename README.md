# AS Notes

## Serious Work in Progress!

I will be using this for some newer notes I will be making,
I will gradually add my older notes as I find the time though
I cannot make any promises as I am sure I have already lost
things.

I'll say this is not up to be contributed too, but as I am doing
this anyway, if you have a specific topic you want notes to be
made on, let me know, I'll do those sooner than later.

## Aim

The reason I am doing all this and migrating all my notes to markdown
comes down to a few things.

Firstly, A lot of my notes are on word documents, and while I can parse them
I want a simpler solution for a project I want to do in the future.

Secondly my notes are often scattered and not backed up anywhere, so
using git as a system to keep my notes seems like a good plan..

Lastly it makes them much easier to share *( lord help anyone who wants*
*to use my notes )* as I know a few people now pursuing the CAIE as I am
and I believe that knowledge should be shared. *( Though I cannot guarantee*
*any knowledge from here. )*
